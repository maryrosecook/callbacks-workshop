# Callbacks and following the flow of control (1 hour)

## Learning objectives

1. Describe "the flow of control of a program" as "the order in which the parts of the code are executed".
2. Explain the process you use to follow the flow of control.
3. Follow the flow of control to help you understand how callbacks work.

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Talk about the [high level goal of the week](README.md#high-level-goal-for-the-week).

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Explain the process for [following the flow of control](README.md#following-the-flow-of-control)

* Demonstrate following the flow of control for the first couple of [questions](README.md#questions).

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

## Main (30 minutes)

* Ask the students to work through the [questions](README.md#questions).

* Ask the students to follow the process for understanding the flow of control that we used in the demo.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Ask the students if they have any questions about the questions.

* Ask how people feel about following the flow of control.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

[No PLENARY.md because there's not really much material besides the questions above.]
